\subsection*{Abstract}

Hadoop and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale
data-intensive applications on commodity clusters. However, these systems have
not considered the bandwidth availability during task-scheduling. The advent of
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) techniques has enabled in choosing the best
routing path but the responsibility of machines' placement lies within Hadoop.
In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware placement scheme in Hadoop that
could also be used to complement SDN techniques.  Our algorithm improves the
throughput of Hadoop applications by 20\% in Fat-Tree~\cite{fattree1985} and
Jellyfish~\cite{jellyfish2012} topology.
